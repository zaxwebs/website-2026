				<p>
					This project translated exceptional product quality into a unified brand presence across
					packaging, social media, and retail touchpoints. The direction was rooted in modern
					elegance with a strong editorial influence.
				</p>
				<p>
					The goal was to help the brand look as premium as it smelled, while preserving flexibility
					for future collections, collaborations, and direct-to-consumer growth.

				<h2 class="mb-8 text-2xl leading-[1.1] tracking-tight lg:text-4xl">Challenges</h2>
				<p>
					Competing in the high end fragrance space demanded a presence that felt both rare and
					credible. The brand had to embody the craftsmanship of oud while remaining agile enough to
					evolve into new blends, formats, and collaborations.
				</p>
				<p>
					The core challenge lay in building an identity anchored in the heritage of oud, while
					articulating it through the visual and experiential language of contemporary Western
					luxury.

			<h2 class="text-2xl leading-[1.1] tracking-tight lg:text-4xl">Strategy & Execution</h2>
			<p>
				We began with positioning workshops to define audience segments, emotional keywords, and
				category whitespace. These insights shaped a brand platform with messaging pillars applied
				across product pages, launch campaigns, and in-store storytelling.

			<h3 class="text-2xl">Visual Identity</h3>
			<p>
				From there, we built a refined identity system across wordmark usage rules, typographic
				hierarchy, color direction, and art direction principles.

			<h3 class="text-2xl">Typography</h3>
			<p>
				The typographic direction was built to mirror the olfactory structure of the fragrances
				themselves. Deep, resinous oud balanced with refined Western notes. Marcellus was chosen for
				its stately, archival character. Its Roman influenced proportions and carved serif detailing
				evoke permanence, ritual, and the weight of tradition. It brings a sense of ceremony to
				product naming and brand signatures. Inter provides the counterpoint. Clean, highly legible,
				and engineered for modern interfaces, it introduces ease and accessibility. Where Marcellus
				is emotive, Inter is rational. This balance ensures the brand feels anchored in heritage
				while articulated with modern precision. Evocative in story, controlled in expression.

			<h3 class="text-2xl">Color Palette</h3>
			<p>
				Primary tones were selected to establish a foundation of richness, rarity, and material
				depth. Royale Gold signals value and prestige, Smoked Oudwood anchors the identity in raw
				authenticity, Silver Dynasty introduces a refined modern counterpoint, and Obsidian delivers
				intensity, mystery and contrast. The secondary palette extends the story outward. Crimson
				Reserve brings warmth and sensuality, Midnight Blue conveys sophistication, and Velour Green
				references the natural origins of agarwood, adding an organic balance to the system.

			<h3 class="text-2xl">Packaging Direction</h3>
			<p>
				Packaging concepts were developed to highlight individual scent personalities while
				maintaining family consistency across the lineup.

			<p>
				The final delivery included a practical brand playbook with reusable templates for social,
				ecommerce banners, and campaign layouts so the team can launch new collections faster
				without compromising consistency.
